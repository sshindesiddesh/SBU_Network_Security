			start the proxy in client mode
			connect to the server
			capture input from the console
			encrypt it and send to the server
			decrypt and send it to the console

	$./pbproxy -l 2222 -k src/key.txt localhost 22

Connect client to the pbproxy
	$ssh -o "ProxyCommand ./pbproxy -k src/key.txt localhost 2222" localhost
Output:
	siddesh@siddesh:~/Fall2017/net_sec/ASSIGNMENT3$ ssh -o "ProxyCommand ./pbproxy -k src/key.txt localhost 2222" localhost
